# Laser Kombat Love
A re-implementation of the abandoned freeware game Laser Kombat in Lua using the Love2d game engine.

I used to play this free game as a kid, but its website is no longer up and it can no longer be downloaded. Since I really enjoyed playing it, I decided to see if I can reverse engineer its levels. This repository contains the results so far.
